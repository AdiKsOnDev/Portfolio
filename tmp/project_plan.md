# Minimalist Portfolio Website - Iteration-Based Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines a systematic approach to building a minimalist portfolio website with Greek letter parallax effects and scroll-styled card components. The project is divided into 7 iterations, each building upon the previous work, ensuring incremental value delivery and thorough testing at each phase.

### Project Vision

A sophisticated, minimalist single-page portfolio featuring floating Greek letters with parallax scrolling, elegant card-based content presentation, and a carefully curated color palette (#EEE4E3, #131313, #BBB8B3).

### Technology Stack (Recommended)

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Styling**: CSS3 with CSS Custom Properties for theming
- **Build Tools**: Vite for development and bundling
- **Version Control**: Git with semantic versioning
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier for code quality
