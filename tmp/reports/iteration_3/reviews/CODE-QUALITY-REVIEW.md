### 3. Navigation & Organization ✅ EXCELLENT (9.5/10)

**File Structure:**

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx (90 lines)
│   └── page.tsx (32 lines)
└── components/
    ├── ParallaxBackground.tsx (228 lines)
    ├── ContactSection.tsx (255 lines)
    ├── AboutSection.tsx (115 lines)
    ├── HeroSection.tsx (102 lines)
    ├── PublicationsSection.tsx (138 lines)
    └── WorkSection.tsx (133 lines)
```

**Code Organization:**

- ✅ Logical component separation by functionality

- ✅ `PARALLAX_LAYERS` configuration centralized
- ✅ Performance thresholds extracted (16ms for 60fps)
- ✅ Styling values properly organized

**Configuration Structure:**

```typescript
const PARALLAX_LAYERS = [
  { speed: 0.2, opacity: 0.15, letterCount: 8 }, // Background layer
  { speed: 0.5, opacity: 0.2, letterCount: 6 }, // Middle layer
  { speed: 0.8, opacity: 0.25, letterCount: 4 }, // Foreground layer
]
```

**Minor Improvement Opportunity:**

- Consider extracting magic numbers (60, 100, 150, 30, 15) to named constants for even better maintainability
