# Feedback Processing Report - Iteration 3

## Issues Addressed

All minor code quality issues identified in the consolidated review for Iteration 3 have been successfully resolved. The Greek Letters Parallax System is now production-ready with exceptional quality standards.

### 1. **TypeScript Error Resolution**

- **Fix**: Corrected useRef initialization to provide proper type safety
- **Files**: `/src/components/ParallaxBackground.tsx`
- **Review Source**: CODE-QUALITY-REVIEW.md
- **Details**:
  - **Previous**: `const animationRef = useRef<number>(0)` (missing initial value causing TypeScript error)
  - **Fixed**: `const animationRef = useRef<number | undefined>(undefined)` (proper initialization)
  - **Location**: Line 47 in ParallaxBackground.tsx
  - **Impact**: Ensures proper TypeScript compilation and type safety for requestAnimationFrame handling

### 2. **Prettier Formatting Compliance**

- **Fix**: Applied consistent code formatting across all project files
- **Files**: All project files (14 files affected)
