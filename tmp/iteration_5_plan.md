# Iteration 5: Ancient Scroll Card Components & Animations

## Executive Summary

Transform the portfolio's card components into authentic ancient scroll designs that seamlessly integrate with the Greek-inspired theme. This iteration will create reusable scroll-styled components with entrance animations and interactive effects that evoke the feeling of unrolling ancient papyrus manuscripts, while maintaining modern functionality and accessibility standards.

## Iteration Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Create ancient scroll-themed card components with thematic animations and hover effects |
| **Theme** | Ancient Greek papyrus scrolls with aged textures and authentic details |
| **Duration** | Estimated 6-8 hours |
| **Dependencies** | Iterations 1-4 completed (Greek parallax, content sections) |
| **Risk Level** | Medium - Balance between aesthetics and functionality |

## Design Philosophy

### Ancient Scroll Aesthetics
- **Papyrus texture**: Subtle aged paper background with natural fibers
- **Rolled edges**: Visual suggestion of scroll ends with decorative caps
- **Greek ornamental borders**: Delicate geometric patterns (meander/key pattern)
- **Aged color palette**: Warm sepia tones, faded ink effects
- **Wax seal accents**: Interactive elements styled as ancient seals

### Animation Themes
- **Unrolling effect**: Cards appear as if scrolls are being unfurled
- **Parchment flutter**: Subtle movement suggesting ancient paper
- **Ink fade-in**: Content appears as if being written by ancient scribes
- **Seal breaking**: Hover effects that simulate breaking wax seals

## Detailed Deliverables

### 1. Core Scroll Component System

#### 1.1 Base ScrollCard Component
```typescript
interface ScrollCardProps {
  variant: 'project' | 'publication' | 'achievement'
  scrollAge: 'ancient' | 'weathered' | 'preserved'
  sealType: 'wax' | 'clay' | 'none'
  borderPattern: 'meander' | 'wave' | 'laurel'
}
```

**Features:**
- Modular scroll structure with customizable aging effects
- SVG-based scroll end caps with Greek ornamental designs
- Layered texture system (papyrus base + aging overlay + fiber details)
- Dynamic shadow system suggesting scroll depth and curling

#### 1.2 Texture & Pattern Library
- **Papyrus Base Texture**: CSS gradient patterns mimicking papyrus fibers
- **Aging Overlays**: Semi-transparent overlays for weathering effects
- **Greek Patterns**: SVG implementations of classic Greek border designs
- **Seal Graphics**: Interactive wax/clay seal components with Greek symbols

### 2. Specialized Scroll Variants

#### 2.1 Project Scroll Card
**Visual Elements:**
- Main scroll body with project details
- Technology tags as small attached parchment pieces
- Wax seal with project number in Greek numerals
- Rolled bottom edge suggesting more content

**Interactive Features:**
- Unroll animation on hover revealing additional details
- Seal "breaks" on first interaction
- Parchment pieces flutter slightly on hover
- Smooth transition between rolled and unrolled states

#### 2.2 Publication Scroll Card
**Visual Elements:**
- Formal manuscript appearance with serif typography
- Citation format mimicking ancient scholarly texts
- Clay tablet seal for academic authenticity
- Decorative initial letters (illuminated manuscript style)

**Interactive Features:**
- Text appears as if being inscribed on hover
- Abstract section unfurls from bottom
- Author names shimmer with gold leaf effect
- Year appears as Roman/Greek numerals with tooltip

#### 2.3 Achievement/Skill Scroll Card
**Visual Elements:**
- Smaller scroll format (like ancient certificates)
- Laurel wreath borders for achievements
- Skill levels shown as filled amphora icons
- Ribbon attachments with additional details

### 3. Animation System

#### 3.1 Entrance Animations
```typescript
interface ScrollAnimation {
  type: 'unroll' | 'fade-inscription' | 'seal-break'
  duration: number
  stagger: number
  easing: 'papyrus-flutter' | 'scribe-pace' | 'seal-snap'
}
```

**Unroll Sequence:**
1. Scroll appears rolled (compressed height)
2. Top cap animates rotation suggesting unrolling
3. Content area expands with papyrus texture revealed
4. Text fades in as if freshly written
5. Decorative elements appear last

#### 3.2 Scroll-Triggered Animations
- **Intersection Observer**: Detect when scrolls enter viewport
- **Staggered Unrolling**: Multiple scrolls unroll in sequence
- **Progressive Revelation**: Content appears in stages
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Scrolls move at different speeds for depth

#### 3.3 Hover & Interaction Effects
- **Parchment Lift**: Slight 3D rotation on hover
- **Edge Flutter**: Subtle animation of scroll edges
- **Seal Glow**: Wax seals emit soft golden glow
- **Text Highlighting**: Important text gets subtle gold underline

```css
/* Papyrus texture using CSS patterns */
.scroll-texture {
  background: 
    /* Fiber pattern */
    repeating-linear-gradient(
      90deg,
      transparent,
      transparent 2px,
      rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.03) 2px,
      rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.03) 4px
    ),
    /* Aging spots */
    radial-gradient(
      ellipse at 20% 30%,
      rgba(139, 69, 19, 0.05) 0%,
      transparent 50%
    ),
    /* Base papyrus color */
    linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      #f4e8d0 0%,
      #e8dcc0 100%
    );
}

/* Greek meander border pattern */
.meander-border {
  border-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...") 30 repeat;
}
```

#### 4.3 Animation Sequences
```typescript
// Unroll animation using Framer Motion or CSS
const unrollAnimation = {
  initial: { 
    height: '120px',
    rotateX: 15,
    opacity: 0.7
  },
  animate: {
    height: 'auto',
    rotateX: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      height: { duration: 0.8, ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] },
      rotateX: { duration: 0.6, delay: 0.2 },
      opacity: { duration: 0.4 }
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Examples

### Basic ScrollCard Implementation
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'
import styles from './ScrollCard.module.css'

interface ScrollCardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  variant?: 'project' | 'publication'
  scrollAge?: 'ancient' | 'weathered' | 'preserved'
  onUnroll?: () => void
}

export function ScrollCard({ 
  children, 
  variant = 'project',
  scrollAge = 'ancient',
  onUnroll 
}: ScrollCardProps) {
  const [isUnrolled, setIsUnrolled] = useState(false)
  const { ref, inView } = useInView({
    threshold: 0.3,
    triggerOnce: true
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView && !isUnrolled) {
      setIsUnrolled(true)
      onUnroll?.()
    }
  }, [inView, isUnrolled, onUnroll])

  return (
    <article
      ref={ref}
      className={`
        ${styles.scrollCard}
        ${styles[variant]}
        ${styles[scrollAge]}
        ${isUnrolled ? styles.unrolled : styles.rolled}
      `}
    >
      <div className={styles.scrollCap}>
        {/* SVG scroll cap design */}
      </div>
      
      <div className={styles.papyrusTexture}>
        <div className={styles.content}>
          {children}
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div className={styles.scrollBottom}>
        {/* Bottom scroll cap */}
      </div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

This iteration plan provides a comprehensive approach to transforming the card components into authentic ancient scroll designs while maintaining all the functionality and modern web standards required for a professional portfolio.
